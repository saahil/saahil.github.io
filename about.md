# Hi
I currently work as Head of AI at a fast-growing B2B SaaS in the regulation tech space, helping manufactured goods companies manage their compliance and homologation requirements with ease.  
Before this I worked as the Head of Product for a foundation model company, where I contributed to development of embedding models and small language models. 
I used to work, before that, for the world's largest re-insurance company, leading teams of software engineers, data scientists and data engineers to solve challenging underwriting, pricing, and analytics problems using [augmented data management](https://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/enterprise-technology-and-performance/articles/augmented-data-management-beyond-the-hype.html).

I hold a doctorate from the [Chair of Software and Systems Engineering](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/sse/homepage/) at Technical University of Munich.
My research at university concerned itself with compositional analysis of large-scale software using smart combinations of fuzzing and machine learning. 
Some of my publications are listed [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CB8116EAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I'm interested in artificial intelligence, open-access publishing and the intersection of technology+journalism. I enjoy kickboxing, bouldering, baking, films, hip-hop and books.

I am on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4789323-saahil-ognawala), [Github](https://github.com/saahil), [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@saahil), [LinkedIn](https://de.linkedin.com/in/saahilognawala) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/saahil_in/?hl=en).
