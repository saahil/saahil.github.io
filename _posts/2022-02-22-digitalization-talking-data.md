While the ten oldest newspapers still in circulation [almost exclusively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_oldest_newspapers) began in Europe, none of these make it to the list of top newspapers by circulation [today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_newspapers_by_circulation). An analogous comparison can be made for the oldest banks and insurance companies in the world too - when compared by their total assets or loss ratios, respectively. 
For most industry veterans, it is not for a lack of digitalization schemes that they haven't been able to conquer modern markets completely, but - and I'm obviously biting off a lot more than I can chew - what that digitalization entails. 

It isn't enough that historical data is digitalized and suitably archived - what matters much more is whether the data is _activated_. 
Activated data is fresh (despite being old), malleable, and [vocal](https://saahil.github.io/technology/philosophy/data/2022/02/10/metaphors).
Activated data knows what it is.

Semantic web is already a magnificent achievement, in terms of categorizing and standardizing data on the internet. Domain knowledge graphs can even further build upon the semantic web idea to _activate_ data, and enable organizations to make decisions and generate value.
