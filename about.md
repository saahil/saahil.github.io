# Hi

I currently work as a product manager and data scientist for a large reinsurance company, where my work involves developing AI products (such as knowledge graphs) and leading teams of software engineers, data scientists and data engineers to solve challenging underwriting, pricing, and analytics problems using [augmented data management](https://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/enterprise-technology-and-performance/articles/augmented-data-management-beyond-the-hype.html).

I hold a doctorate from the [Chair of Software and Systems Engineering](https://www.in.tum.de/en/i04/homepage/) at Technical University of Munich.
My research at university concerned itself with compositional analysis of large-scale software using smart combinations of fuzzing and machine learning. 
Some of my publications are listed [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CB8116EAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I'm interested in artificial intelligence, open-access publishing and the intersection of technology+journalism. I enjoy kickboxing, bouldering, baking, films, hip-hop and books.

I am on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4789323-saahil-ognawala), [Github](https://github.com/saahil), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/saahil), [LinkedIn](https://de.linkedin.com/in/saahilognawala) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/saahil_in/?hl=en).
